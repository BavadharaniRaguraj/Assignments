Step 1: Creating service for scaling 

Please Note: 
    Docker containers deployed on Docker swarm cluster can be scaled up and down to implement high availability of Docker containers. 
    If in case any Docker container gets crashed, we can get a new one created and other containers can easily handle the load. 


	Use the commands below to create a service and scale the service up and down to increase or decrease Docker containers
             docker service create -p 8080:8080 --name bootcampjocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
             docker service ls
             docker service psbootcamp
             curl localhost:8080

 

	Once the container deployed, we can scale up and down the Docker swarm service following the process shown below
             docker service scale bootcamp=3
             docker service psbootcamp
             curl localhost:8080
