Step 1: Setting up a Docker instance

	Type the following command to check the docker version installed :

	    docker version
 

Step 4.3.2: Building a custom Docker image to be deployed

	First, clone the Git repository on Docker host using the command below:
	   git clone https://github.com/Anuj1990/Docker.git

	Run with docker build command to build a custom Docker image
	   cd Docker 
	   docker build -t phpcode . -f Dockerfile

	Once the image is built, check if it is built properly or not. You can see a Docker image entry using Docker images command

 

Step 3: Initializing a Docker swarm cluster and deploying a container to the cluster

	First, we need to initialize Docker swarm using the set of commands given below:
	   docker swarm init
	   docker node ls
 
	Once the node is configured, deploy the custom Docker image on the Docker swarm cluster following the process shown below
	   docker service create -p 80:80 --name webserver phpcode
	   docker service ls
	   curl localhost
